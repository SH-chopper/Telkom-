      <p>Our home automation project is called "Telkom+". It is a deliberate spelling error sourcing from the short-form of Telecommunication, Telcom. This deliberation of this spelling error is due to the characteristic that is common to all people is that they pay more attention to the details when there is something not right, and thus, this is our own way so that people are conscious of our brand</p>

          <H4>Personal Information</H4>
          <p>Hi! My name is Gerald Dwi Cipta. My student number is s3666265 and my email address is <a href="mailto:s3666265@student.rmit.edu.au">s3666265@student.rmit.edu.au</a>.</p>
          <p>Im an international student from Indonesia and currently studying in RMIT's finest Australian campus graduating in winter 2020. As for now, I'm only able to speak Indonesian, English, Chinese. I'm looking forward to learn French because I think that it is an interesting language to communicate with. I consider Racing is my main sport and my hobby. A really interesting fact about me is when i eat a pizza slice, i often leave the crust because I think that it just taste too doughy and i dislike it. My interest in IT includes designing the database architecture. When I was 15 years old, before I took this BP308 Business Information Systems, my elder brother showed me a couple of his projects, which included him putting his customer base for his phone application in a database using MySQL. In just one line of SQL, he could filter out his under 18 users, over 50 users and can see the demographic of his customer base when he needs to review his target market for the application. Me at that point of time not knowing anything about databases, I was amazed and keen to learn more about this database management systems, asked what course is available to learn more about this database and my study agent recommended me this BP308 course.</p>

          <p>The MBTI test shows that I'm a Debater (ENTP-T), after a further reading of what a debater personality means, it shows that I'm an excellent brainstormer where a debater can analyse problems in every point of view and tackle the problem in every aspect. Debaters also are quick thinkers, knowledgeable, energetic and charismatic. On the other side, from the learning style test, it shows that I'm a "Tactile Learner" where i learn by touching, which means that I need to have a grasp of the item or object that I'm learning by doing, which means that I'm a type of autodidact, learning to do thing by actively doing it. Last but not least, the creativity test shows that my creativity percentage is 63.16% (average), with that I'm short of the persistence aspect which means that I'm not that type to force myself to improve something that I consider to be "enough" or "good". Compiling everything, all of this test information might be useful to a group by helping a team to brainstorm all problem-solving solutions for all of the current situation. I can also help the team to learn when they do not know or have no idea on how to start the task as I learn while I do while bringing the team with me and go through the task together as a team.</p>

      <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
          <p>This job is an IT Business Analyst job. It is a bridge that connects both IT world and the business world as business analyst helps business to implement technology to meet their needs and requirements and to tackle each and every possible problem in a cost-effective manner. A bachelors degree in Business Information Systems to know what and how should we do. Next, the skills needed for this job includes working in groups, communication skill, problem-solving skill and critical-thinking skills. </p>
          <p>Comparing my ideal job with others, John and Nicholas has the same ideal job which is software engineer, where there is very less similarity, but I will still be working in order to fix the business problems using their coding skills. Patrick's ideal job will have the most common elements compared tot he others where we both need to organize staff, but his concer will be mainly about the organization's inventory management system. With Kelvin's job, his job is all about security where the common elements are we both analyse the problem and propse possible solutions but my ideal job is mainly about business processes while Kelvin's job is about the cyber security. Lastly, Tonys's job is almost similar to John's and Nicholas' ideal job, but Tony's job is about building the software website and application. Tony's job can collaborate withe my ideal job when I propose a problem which needs a technological solution, we can brainstorm how the application or sftware will be or look like to overcome the problems and turn it to a technological solution.</p>

      <h3>John Usaraga</h3>
      <img src = johnpic.png style="width:300px;height:300px;">
          <H4>Personal Information</H4>
              <p>Hi there, My name is John Mikael Usaraga, but most people call me Mikey. My studentID is S3842470. I was born in Melbourne, Australia, however, my parents are both Filipino. At home, my parents communicate to me in Tagalog, but I can only understand what they are saying because I have trouble speaking it as English is my native language. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include playing video games, watching anime and playing sports such as badminton and basketball. I have been playing badminton for 5-6 years now, but I don't play it as frequently as I used to.</p>
              <p>Growing up I had always played video games on console and pc. When playing these games there would sometimes be a new patch/update to a game before it runs. What intrigued me was how these patches were able to improve the game whether it be to fix a bug or to add more content to the game. From this, I started to develop an interest in IT as I wanted to find out how these updates worked. Having researched about it I came to an understanding that IT is used in a lot more interesting ways and am now fascinated by the actual coding/programming behind certain programs/software.  </p>
  <br><br>
          <H4>Team Profile</H4>
              <p><b>Myers-Briggs Test</b> -Protagonist ENFJ-A <br> Mind: 63% Extraverted, 37% Introverted Energy: 60% Intuitive, 40% Observant Nature: 72% Feeling, 28% ThinkingTactics: 71% Judging, 29% Prospecting Identity: 79% Assertive, 21% Turbulent
              <br><br>
                  <b>Learning Style Test</b> -Auditory 30%, Visual -50%, Tactile -20% 
              <br><br>    
                  <b>Big Five Personality Test</b>-Openness 85%, Conscientiousness 73%, Extraversion 69%, Agreeableness 73%, Neuroticism 21%<br><br>
                  I feel like these results will influence my behaviour spositively. The traits I have which I believe will be the most influential when working in a team are my intuitiveness, judging personality, extraversion, and agreeableness. When problems are present during a group project, my intuitiveness would allow meto come up with ideas to help improve the situation/issue. This would be supported by my extraversion and agreeableness as I would be able to voice my ideas comfortably without creating any unnecessary arguments. To be more productive when working in the team my judging personality would allow me and others to stay on track, maximising our time working on the project. If things go wrong during the project this personality would also work well with my intuitiveness as I could also come up with other plans if a problem does arise.My protagonist personality states that I take genuine pleasure when "getting to know other people, and have no trouble with people of all types." This would suggest that I would have no problem when forming a team with others as I am comfortable interacting with them. Some of the traits of someone who has a protagonist personality are being optimistic, kind and creative. I believe that these traits would also help me ease into a team of people with whom I have just met.</p>
  <br><br>
          <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
              <p>My ideal job is working as a software engineer, developing and building computer systems software and applications software. This occupation appeals to me the most as the work I'd do could branch out into developing operating systems and computer games. Due to my experiences growing up, being influenced by video games, I believe that this job is ideal for me. For this job, I would need to master a variety of programming languages, such as C++, C#, JavaScript, and Python. Some general skills I would also need to have for this job include software development, Object-oriented design (OOD), Software testing and debugging, problem-solving and logical thinking, written and verbal communication, teamwork.</p>
              <p>Comparing this job with those of the other members of this group, I have come to realize how IT can expand into different types of jobs. Out of the 6 members of the group, I do share the same Job interest with one of them. What differentiates my ideal job with the rest, is that this job focuses on developing and building computer systems software and applications software, whereas the other ones focus on aspects such as: carrying out security measures to protect computer networks and systems, managing inventory tracking systems, designing software systems and applications, and analyzing how well software and hardware fit the business needs of their employer or a client. Although, as most of the jobs each group member finds ideal is different, they all do share a similarity when it comes to some of the requirements for the job and also some general skills to have.</p>

      <h3>Nicholas Santosa</h3>
      <img src = nickpic.jpeg style="width:200px;height:300px;">
          <H4>Personal Information</H4>
              <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Christopher Santosa. My RMIT student id is s3844591 and my RMIT student email is <a
                href='mailto:s3844591@student.rmit.edu.au'>s3844591@student.rmit.edu.au</a>.
            I was born in New Zealand, Auckland on March 23rd, 2002, Saturday. From 2007 onwards I have been living in
            Melbourne and grew up in an Indonesian household. My first language is English and I'm somewhat fluent in
            Bahasa (Indonesian). I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and in my first
            year. I have finished school from Prep to Year 12. I went to Stella Maris in Point Cook for my Primary
            school and moved to Emmanuel College Notre Dame Campus from year 7 to 12. I have a pet dog. She's a Labrador, her name is Nugget and has been in my family for two years. My main hobby
            is cars, more about JDM and modifying cars, but I also enjoy watching F1 and the overall understanding of
            how cars work. I also enjoy music and play the guitar, piano and have a passion for singing.</p>
  <br><br>
          <H4>Team Profile</H4>
              <p>The Myers Briggs test results show that I’m an Advocate (INFJ-T). Upon further inspection an Advocate has an introverted mind, intuitive energy, feeling nature, judging tactics and turbulent identity. An advocate is sensitive to how others feel, creative and focused on the future. I believe I have all of those traits except for the Intuitive nature, where I believe I am more observant and can pick things up. According to the Learning test I took, I’m a visual learner. As a visual learner I need graphs, pictures and to read reports to understand the content better. I need to be able to write down information to contain it. This test accurately represents how I learn. I usually study using pictures and notes that use colour or diagrams to study. My creativity test result is 55.01, this means I can manage with work given to me in quantities and manage it very well, showing how organised I am. My work can be anything and I will be able to accept the work, even if it's contradictory. My perspective also shows that I am able to shift my perspective depending on the situation, making me flexible. I believe this test is also accurate, I feel like I’m very organised being on top of everything I do and I’m able to complete multiple different tasks. The test also says that I can shift my perspective depending on the situation and I think that's true, there have been many accounts where I can adapt to the situation. I probably feel like I need a bit of apparent connection before I can understand it and that I have more persistence then what the test says I do. This information can be helpful to the group, letting them know I can make decisions, my organisation skills, how my learning style is visual and I’m flexible with the workload and my position in the group.</p>
  <br><br>
          <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
          <p>My ideal job is a Software Engineer. A Software Engineer creates an outline for programmers to program. They work closely with team members and internal participants to problem solve through software development. Software Engineers need strong database development skills, ability to communicate effectively and efficiently, strong problem-solving skills and ability to use web services. I have the same ideal job as Mikey except he prefers to be in a senior role which may require him to have more of a leadership role. Gerald’s ideal job is different to mine, as mine concerns code and software development while his is focused around using analysis and design techniques to fix business problems with information technology. Tony’s job is very similar to mine dealing with code, but mine develops what coders should do, he troubleshoots the coding problems and what processors and technologies the development team should use. Kelvin’s ideal job is focused on security for companies and doesn’t this by monitoring security issues and installs software to protect their systems, they may create the softwares that they use, which is linked to my job, but my job is focused on creating softwares and code. Partick and I’s job aren’t closely linked, but my job can create softwares that Patrick may implement when monitoring transactions, margins, returns, and other financial data to inform decision makers. <p>

              <H4>Personal Information</H4>
              <p>Hello there, my name is Patrick Cruz and my studentID is s3657537. I'm born in the Philippines but moved to Australia when I was young, so I don't recall much of Philippines. Current education is undertaking a Bachelor of Business majoring in logistics and supply chain management. Previous education is the completion of year 12 and a Diploma of Logistics studied at RMIT. Online gaming is a heavy interest to me and being able to interact with people all over the world in different types of games are one of my main hobbies. My interest in IT is mainly the potential optimization of everyday tasks and chores that can be adapted to utilize a certain technology or program that will streamline the process.
            <br><br>
                My interest in IT came at a young age from playing on the computer for long enough that I wanted to know how they worked. With technology become more and more incorporated within our every day lives, future developments in thecareer field I am pursuing may rely on such technologies. To be able to stay relevant in the required skill sets I believe that it is important to have a good understanding in the way the technology works and not just use it. I chose to come to RMIT because of the location of the main city campus and otherreviews from online friends that took the same course I am currently undergoing. Within my bachelor im currently in the 3rd and final year before completion, within this course introduction to IT I am hoping to understand and be able to further strengthen my knowledge of different applications that may assist the logistical side of business in the future. It is my assumption that the future of Logistics will incorporate far more usage of technology to assist and being able to understand how it all works can be a beneficial skill.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kelvin Huynh, my student number is s3854638 and my work e-mail is <a href="mailto:s3854638@student.rmit.edu.au">s3854638@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. My natinality is a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese. I speak a couple of languages that includes English, Chinese and Teochew. An interesting fact about me is that I have worked in Target for about 3 years now as a casual. </p>
                <p>I have always been fascinated with technology. How electronics functions, how programs are built and how technology is involved every day. My interest in IT began when I started playing video games. I noticed that the games were running slower, which made me curious to find a solution to work out why these programs were slowing down. I chose to come to RMIT as I have heard that this university has a known reputation for great success in this course. During my studies I hope to learn more about programming and how technology functions.</p>

          <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
              <p>This advertisement offers the position of a cyber security analyst to work on making sure that the cyber security requirements are up to date with the MFB organisation. It offers the chance to work with other IT teams within the MFB organisation to ensure that cyber security is embedded at all locations. This job is appealing to me, as it offers the chance to work with a organisation that already strives to help and save lives. This position does require a minimum of 5 years of experience in working in other cyber security roles, the ability to conversate with others that un-aware of IT, prior knowledge of cloud environments and have experience with security measures including; encryptions, password access management systems and proxies. This position also requires knowledge in SIEM tools.</p>
               <p>Each member in our groups falls under the same category of working within an organisation to provide services in order for that organisation to run efficiently. When comparing my ideal job as a cyber security analyst to the members in my group, similarities are visible with system analysing and inventory management. Although my ideal job mainly focuses on analysing and planning security measures to protect an organisation, we share a common purpose of problem solving, planning and managing aspects of an organisation. In contrast, my ideal job differentiates when compared to software engineering and software architecture. Although we are working in a specific IT field, they would focus on programming and coding which is a skill that cyber security analysts do not require. To summarise, our group contains members that do share the same similarities of my ideal job with others focusing on a different aspect when working in the industry.</p>

My family are from Taiwan although I was born and raised in Australia. graduated from Doncaster Secondary College last year, Doncaster Primary school 2013 and was a exchange student in china for a short period of time in 2016 and 2017I can speak English, understand and speak basic Chinese and somewhat understand Hokkien. A fun fact about myself,  am really into gaming (Nintendo), anime and watching MMA</p>

        <br><br>  
        <p>I am not necessarily surprised by my results; it just shows that I have areas to improve in. For example, for my personality I wish I could be less of an introvert and instead improve, be more outgoing and less shy. As I feel if I do this it’ll benefit me in the future in terms of group work. I could also on my creativity as I feel like the job or work, I take on,  might require a lot of creativity. Due to these results, I think these results may suggest I am more  of  a  follower  than  a  leader,  although  I  would  like  to  improve  on  that  so  I  can contribute to group assignments rather than just listen and do. When forming a team, I should look for some that might be a natural leader, as in they might take in charge of the team and have an idea of the larger idea .However, I do think, it depends of the type of work my group is doing, as there is times I may become the leader. I should also look for people that work well in teams and ask for feedback/ can socialise </p>
      <br><br>
        <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
          <p>My ideal job is working as a web developer for any company, a web developer which oversees everything related to a website that is to the company’s vision. So that can be building the website e.g. coding, layout, or design etc. therefore a web developer is expected to have a balance between programming and design. This position is appealing to me as it is relating to IT and there is some sort of creativity, So I can have a new experience every time as I need to design the website to someone’s wants. I would need to have experience in VMS such as WordPress, Magento, Drupal and Joomla, therefore have successfully built websites. This position also requires already have experience in working with agencies and being able to code in the most efficient way possible. This position also requires the web developer to know networking, user interface, data base and knowledge a full stack programmer would know.</p>
          <p>When comparing and contrasting each ideal job for each person in the group. It seems like although the common element behind most ideal jobs are IT related, each job is related to a different part of IT/combined with other areas. Out of our group my job is the most similar or at least shares similar traits as software engineering. As software engineering applies mathematical analysis and the principles of computer science in order to design and develop computer software where as a software architect is a developer who communicates with businesses and clients to design and execute solutions with a team of software engineers. So the commonality between these two jobs is that we use the knowledge of computer science to make or fix something. Whereas the other jobs are different in terms of the goal. For example cybersecurity is about the protection of computer networks and systems and a system analysis focuses on the analysis of information systems.  So some jobs may share similar aspects of the job.Even a job like  system and inventory analysis still uses IT to a certain degree to make it easier to keep track of inventory. Overall I think that our career plans across the group are quite different as each job goes over the different aspects of IT.</p>

  <h1>IT Technologies</h1>
  <ol>
    <li style="font-size:30px"><h2>Cloud Computing</h2></li>
        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <ol type="A">
          <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4></li>
            <p>Currently the state of the art for cloud computing is Kamatera, but have other top competitors like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Kamatera is a cloud service that has “14 Global Data Centers across 4 continents” (15 Top Cloud Computing Service Provider Companies, 2020) making their cloud service very secure, and generates a lot of storage for users to create/use for work, school, or personal materials. The cloud computing service is very “customisable and tailored” (Top 21 Cloud Computing Service Provider Companies in 2020, 2020) for complete user control with ease of use, from the scalability to the ability to “add load balancers, firewalls, private networks and even apps” (Top 21 Cloud Computing Service Provider Companies in 2020, 2020). </p>
            <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What can be done now?</h4></li>
            <p>Cloud computing already has a stable infrastructure, but one modification to it can be with AI. AI can be embedded with the cloud where AI “monitors, manages, and even self-heal when an issue occurs.” (Alton, 2020). AI is also able to make data management more efficient helping the way data is “ingested, updated, and managed” (Alton, 2020), these improvements will have a major impact on “marketing, customer service, and supply chain data management” (Alton, 2020). Cloud computing has security flaws, but it can be improved by implementing Multi-factor authentication. It is the “most efficient and cheapest way” (D'Silva, 2020) to secure data. Cloud computing can also benefit from WANOP or load-balancing, this controls the flow of traffic between distributed data center locations” (Kleyman, 2020) and load-balancing allows you to “scale your data center” (Kleyman, 2020). Data control is important for cloud storage, and it can be improved by implementing “data tiers” (Kleyman, 2020) which you can assign data to the right type of storage.</p>
            <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4></li>
            <p>The transition to fully digital methods of storing and transmitting data is possible today due to the power of cloud services, in the future these will be able to be scaled up tremendously and aid in many different fields. A breakthrough was announced in 2019 by google in which a quantum computer they developed was able to solve a mathematical calculation that would take today's supercomputers 10,000 years to complete, in only three and a half minutes. This leads to the potential of handling more complex data. A remote surgery utilizing 5G and cloud services was done, a surgeon from a Chinese city of Sanya was able to operate on a patient in Beijing which is nearly 1,900 miles away. This potential may allow for even greater, more complex medical procedures to be undertaken by a specialist while not needing to be directly in contact with the patient.</p>
            <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4></li>
            <p>The development of quicker internet quality and speed allow cloud services to provide what they offer with speed and reliability in today’s busy world. Improving the network speed makes consumers desire a quick and responsive service that allows for almost real time management of cloud services. The digital security that is needed to ensure that all data stored and distributed is safe and secure without it being lost, corrupted and tampered with. As the reliance of cloud backups and cloud services grow day by day the required space to store and hold all the information distributed grows, data storages and their ability to contain all the information is vital in ensuring that the service is able to sustain all its users and provide their selected usages.</p>
        </ol>

      <br><br>  

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>One of the impacts to an organization includes them having a lower operating cost, this is due to the elimination of the need to build the company’s own IT infrastructure, thus, saving land and capital in terms of factors of production (2014). In addition to that, companies may also reduce the need of expenditure in services and maintenance costs. On top of that, there will also be a change in the business environment where files and other documents can be accessible anywhere and anytime as long as the user is connected to the internet. The most affected sector in the organization is the user (staff), as they need to get used to the change in collaboration. Next, is the IT maintenance team, they will have a little less work in managing the files and documents in the organization, but the IT security team will be allocated more as they need to keep the business data and documents safe. The upper management can keep track on how their team is performing based on the contributions of the team and the amount of time spent reflected in the cloud service. Due to the concern about security threats, organizations may want to hire people to keep their files and documents safe in the cloud (2014) .There will be a cut in the IT maintenance sector where after the cloud computing is implemented in the organization and more allocation of manpower to the IT security team as the organization will need to secure their datas which is held by the third party organization (The cloud). There will be a minor change in the current technology as most likely, the organization has already allocated a laptop to each staff, but if not, the organization needs a sufficient laptop to do their work. </p>

        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
        <ol type="A">
          <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h4></li>
            <p>Cloud computing affects the collaboration part of daily life. It benefits the group projects for university work, giving us the ability to collaborate easily. It allows us to upload files and our work easily and efficiently to let us create the best work. It will also affect our daily lives once university is over, helping with the collaboration in the workplace, similar with the group projects in university.</p>
          <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What will be different for you?</h4></li>
            <p>The vast difference can actually be perceived in the current situation of this COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to go out of our house, we are still able to collaborate with the other team members, for example, I am writing this assignment in my house and still be able to get a live update of what the others are doing currently, and that will prove that in the future, with advancement of technology, all business processes can be done at home (Ranger, S., 2018). Also, I don't need to have a physical storage device to store my images and other files as the cloud enables us to store our assets in the cloud, in addition to that, we can access our assets without even connecting our storage device to the computer.</p>
          <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4></li>
            <p>The usage of cloud computing can be observed in our everyday office lives by the usage of emails and data backups, everything done on a smartphone is backed up on a cloud service allowing you to access the files on multiple devices. This has many beneficial effects such as file sharing and the ability to upgrade hardware without the hassle of transferring files. Sharing between 2 different people can simply be done by providing a link with access to the required folders or documents.</p>

    <li style="font-size:30px"><h2>Data Science/Analytics</h2></li>
      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <ol type="A">
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4></li>
          <p>Currently the state of the art technology for Data Statistic/Analytics is Sisense, like cloud computing it also has many competitors, such as, Looker and Zoho Analytics. Sisense allows users to put all their “information from different sources into a unified repository, produces visual and robust analysis reports with ease and ability to easily share data, information and reports” (Sisense Reviews: Pricing & Software Features of sisense.com | FinancesOnline, 2020). It’s system allows it to “maximise 64-bit computers, multi-core CPUs and parallelization capabilities to create a very rapid and efficient system” (Sisense Reviews: Pricing & Software Features of sisense.com | FinancesOnline, 2020). The app has an In-Chip engine that allows users to ask any question with an immediate response. Sisense also has a Single Stack architecture that performs data integration to visualisation with a single BI solution with instant deployment. All the data is analyzed accurately and in real time to avoid data errors when analyzing big or small amounts of data, they do this by compiling all this data in a single place. Sisense also has the ability to be integrated with other applications using Sisense’s REST API.</p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What can be done now?</h4></li>
          <p>Sisense and many other state of the art data statistic/analytics software/applications have pretty much done everything it can for Data Statistic/Analytics. Improvements can’t seem to come from the software of these applications, but the way users implement these to their business or lives. Business’ can use Data statistics/analytics to understand the averages and probability, this can help for “profit/loss statements, but also to figure out how to use different business operations effectively” (How Statistics And Data Analytics Can Improve Your Business, 2020). These data statistics/analytics applications can be implemented to  a business’ performance metrics, showing data of employees if they’re “pulling their weight” and check the business’ performance as a whole, showing how efficiently it's working. This also works well with the hiring process, which in turn increases “market share” (How Statistics And Data Analytics Can Improve Your Business, 2020).</p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4></li>
          <p>The ability to better make decisions by utilizing data and artificial intelligence to use the data and create the best case scenario, uses of this can be observed in auto piloting cars, they use sensors that feed them with all sorts of data to be able to determine a path acceptable to the situation required. In the future this may be attached to car insurance premiums where you provide the sensor details from your vehicle so insurance companies can better visualise how you use your vehicle and provide the most custom-made policy. Every device in the future may be able to be linked together to exchange all data about itself such as location, health, weather, error messages and be able to be self-diagnosed by  artificial intelligence  to be able to inform us when the machine breaks down to be able to  schedule maintenance before it happens.</p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4></li>
          <p>The ability to use Predictive analytics enable data previously collected to be able to provide a low risk decision of the potential trends in the future, mixing this with artificial intelligence that is able to decipher all this information and sperate the important parts and focus on improvements with that data. Cloud computing in distributing the large amounts of data required to provide analytics and provide backups to information gathered. Certain programs are specifically designed to interpret the massive amount of data gathered by analytics and condense them into usable information that can be focused on improving or optimizing decisions made, such programs include Amazon EMR, Apache Hive and many others. As more sensors become more accurate and the ability to record more things grows, so does the adaptability of analytics and the predictions they can create.</p>
      </ol>
<br><br>

      <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>Data Statistic/Analytics defines as investigation of raw data in order to make it a meaningful piece of information for the organization. This development will impact an organization's way of decision making and boosting an organization’s competitive advantage by a quicker reaction to consumer behaviour which leads to opening new opportunities to the organization and thus, competitive advantage for the business (Impact of Data Analytics in Business: A Modern Approach, 2018). The obvious change of data analytics is that the organization management and decision making style would be very dynamic as the datas will vary every second, the organization will make a lot of predictions and get deeper insight of the organization. The most affected people would be business analyst, as they are consistently improving organization’s business process, data analyst, with a various constant data coming in, they must make the report and make predictions, lastly, product manager, as they are in charge of getting the information about consumer taste and following the customer’s needs and wants. This will clearly make new job opportunities, as organizations will do anything to gain competitive advantage and thus, making new job space for data scientists and data analysts (Sandlin, 2015). There will also be a creation of jobs in the organization’s R&D team for the data statistics AI to make more accurate predictions for the upcoming future.</p>

    <li style="font-size:30px"><h2>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2></li>
      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <ol type="A">
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4></li>
          <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is getting bigger, with easier and cheaper access to the internet as well as many different devices that can be connected. Therefore, there are many states of the art of IoT. Such as devices that can help with the daily lives for instance Skybell or Ring which are focused on smart video doorbells. Through connecting a doorbell to your smartphone, you can hear and talk to visitors as well as be alerted to movement. Or TP-Link or Deako which have smart LED light switches and bulbs, enabling the user to have freedom to turn on the light or change colour from anywhere. Thus, making it simple and convenient for one's style. IoT can also be used for much larger tasks such as MyMDBand which help provide medical information about the user like medical conditions, vaccinations or medical tests, changing the landscape of storing medical information. Cujo uses IoT to create a “smart firewall” which can protect connected devices in your home from cyber attack and hackers creating a safer place.</p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What can be done now?</h4></li>
          <p>The Internet of Things currently is a very stable system, the biggest issue to the Internet of Things is potentially how vulnerable and exposed it is to be hacked. Given that data is stored in a cloud and the ever growing number of devices using the internet, if targeted and hacked into, many important and valuable data will be exposed to the world.  This could be stopped with the creation of future AI that can detect this problems as current AI that are on offer have limits that it cannot get around due to the large amount of data base AI have to go through.</p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4></li>
          <p></p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4></li>
          <p></p>
        </ol>

    <br><br>

      <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>“As per the research, there will be approximately 20.4 billion IoT devices connected to the internet by the year 2020, out of which, 90% of automobiles will be connected to the web.” Due to the large growth of  modern day devices integrating with internet connectivity, it’ll force organizations to redesign their data and analytical capabilities, take up new data management technologies and platforms, and create new governance policies and practices to take measures for all this data. Ted Friedman, a vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner (IT service management company), had explained at a data & analytics summit how through 2019, ‘one third of IoT solutions will be abandoned before deployment due to lack of data management and analytics capabilities adapted for IoT’.</p>
          <p>Things that are likely to change are due to IoT are smarter homes, and wearable technology. Despite how these changes provide new products and possibilities for users, IoT will also allow for changes within the way we do business. Things such as: Inventory Management where smart devices will eventually be able to automatically track inventory, Consumer Demands and how these consumers will get used to using ‘smart devices’ which allows others to develop and meet these new demands and offers, and Remote Work as IoT becomes more integrated, more remote working opportunities will become available for tasks which had required people to be on-site to complete.</p>
          <p>People who will most likely be affected by IoT are people in hospitality, retail, manufacturing and farmers. For hospitality, hotels are already introducing a facial recognition system where they are able to recognise customers when they enter and leave. With retail, rather than visiting stores, people might soon be able to try on different outfits without leaving their homes using augmented reality or virtual reality. For manufacturers, it will help them track assets in their factories which increase their analytics functionality through installing predictive maintenance systems. Lastly, for farmers, ‘smart agriculture’ is already being implemented through the use of agriculture drones and sensors, later, potentially monitoring every plant and animal individually, assigning each with personal feeding or medical regime.</p>
          <p>As IoT is connecting millions of devices to the internet, it allows for more jobs to be created as there would be a need for more IT professionals. It is said how “by the year 2020, 250,000 IoT applications would have been developed” which would mean that there would be more opportunities for developers. Ultimately, IoT will create more jobs than it will take away.</p>

      <ol type="A">
        <li style="font-size:20px">
          <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly used in our daily life. The connection between our devices to the internet is already used by many people. IoT expands the use of technologies at home with smart home systems that allow users to control aspects of their home with a command from their phone. These aspects include controlling the lighting and temperature of a household. IoT has also allowed us to use smart appliances such as fridges that can control the temperature of food items in different sections of a fridge. In my daily life, IoT is greatly used at home. My phone and smart home devices are connected to the internet which allows me to control the light switches from my phone. I also use smart wearables such as Fitbit, which connects via Bluetooth to my phone. The collation of my heart rate and steps are then transmitted via the internet so it is uploaded to my phone. IoT connects us to our devices where technology is now commonly used. IoT is also commonly used for mobile payments. IoT connects phones to their banks allowing us to use mobile payments to pay for goods and services. IoT also allows banks to use applications that we can control to view our money balances and saving accounts. IoT affects my family and friends with the use of applications such as WeChat or Messenger. IoT is being used by these applications where our devices would connect to the internet and transmit data to these applications allowing my family and friends to communicate to each other over the internet via texting or video calls. IoT is used by our parents making it easy for them to connect devices to save and share photos on the internet. </p>

    <li style="font-size:30px"><h2>Cybersecurity</h2></li>
      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <ol type="A">
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4></li>
          <p>Cybersecurity is a very comparative area, therefore there is no one single company with state of the art of cybersecurity but instead there are many. Securiti.AI provides AI-powered PrivacyOps solutions for today's privacy regulations “ (Top 10 Most Innovative Cybersecurity Companies After RSA 2020, 2020) thus easing the workload and making information hard to access for attackers. Similarly ImmuniWeb aims to use artificial intelligence to aim for “reduce complexity and costs” for companies (Top 10 Most Innovative Cybersecurity Companies After RSA 2020, 2020). Which can allow them to accelerate monitoring among many other things to help combat cyber attackers. Qulays uses an “all in one cloud based app” (Top 10 Most Innovative Cybersecurity Companies After RSA 2020, 2020) which can automate many of the difficult tasks such as automating the vulnerability management cycle across endpoints, cloud and more. It can also help detect and protect IT assets, thus saving time and convenience which could be used for other tasks and be able to respond to other threats or attacks.  </p>
        <li style="font-size:20px"><h4>What can be done now?</h4></li>
          <p>What can be done now to cybersecurity is to make it more difficult to infiltrate from cyber attackers although it is easier said than done as there are many cybersecurity threats. For example, malware attacks, password decryption, hacking. However, there are ways to improve cybersecurity such as the use of artificial intelligence, as with the improvement in technology cyber criminals are using, AI can detect these suspicious movements and identify them. Thus, protecting and securing the important information as AI can do more than one person. Like AI, the improvement automation can reduce the workload for the cybersecurity companies as it can also help block and detect attacks.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity is important in our daily life. Cyber security protects our information from being spread. Financial information and personal information can be stored on the internet making cybersecurity an important measure. The simple use of cybersecurity would be setting a protection for our devices with the use of passwords, passcodes or biometrics scanning. Security patches and software updates are provided by manufacturers to keep us safe from any threats or malicious attacks. We live in a time where security is a measure that manufacturers take when designing our devices, with programs that allow our biometrics to unlock our devices. Cybersecurity allows us to download files from the internet safely. When downloading from the internet, a security measure would scan the file to detect any virus or malware that could be contained in that file. Preventing hackers or organisations from stealing our data. Many services that we use are now providing 2-step verifications logins. This toggles the users to sign in twice to gain access to an account, by sending codes that can only be found in designated locations. If a hacker were to gain access to a user’s username and password as this cybersecurity measure would prevent them from accessing your account as they do not have access to the designated location. Cybersecurity is commonly used with our family and friends as they would also follow the same measures of setting passwords and using biometric scanners to protect their information.</p>

  <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Telkom+ is just a simple mini computer that uses Raspberry Pi as the "MiddleMan" for the wall power socket to the electrical appliance to make it automated. This product of Telkom+ will then be connected to the home wifi to obtain the static IP address of the Raspberry Pi and so the wifi signal can control the Raspberry Pi to kill the power or reconnect the power to the electrical appliance. </p>
    <p>Next, the phone application is created using the python programming language, that will be compatible with all phone OS, whether it is iOS or Android. First, when you tap on the application, a username and password is requested or simply the user can turn the FaceID that iOS has or the user fingerprint. After the credentials are verified by the app, the home screen will appear. The home screen consists of all personalised electrical appliances, where the user can put which electrical appliance in which side of the phone screen, for example, I want to put the home heater on top of the screen and the garage door on the bottom. After the user selects which appliance he / she wants to control, the screen will then go to the next page with it showing whether it is either open / closed or on / off. </p>
    <p>After this, the user can then see the state of the appliance and can do further actions such as locking the front door, watching the live view of the CCTV or turning off the stove.</p>
